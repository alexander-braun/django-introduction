# install django in virtual environment with 'pipenv install django'

# activate virtual environment and use python in virtual environment (not python installed globally) with 'pipenv shell'

# use django-admin to start new project: 'django-admin startproject storefront .'

# manage.py is wrapper around django-admin -> manage.py takes settings of project into account: f.e. run 'python manage.py runserver'
